# Sales Reference

This document provides the logic and patterns for sales, pricing, and marketing commands.

## Pricing Logic

### Partner Channel Calculations

```
Base Price = product.base_price

Referrer (10%):
  partner_fee = base_price × 0.10
  you_receive = base_price × 0.90

Affiliate (20%):
  partner_commission = base_price × 0.20
  you_receive = base_price × 0.80

Reseller (30%):
  partner_margin = base_price × 0.30
  you_receive = base_price × 0.70
  (partner may sell at higher price, keeping extra)

Fronting (15%):
  partner_fee = project_value × 0.15
  you_receive = project_value × 0.85
```

### Project Pricing Formula

```
Project Total = License
              + Add-ons
              + Services
              + Support (optional)

Typical Ranges:
  SME Basic:        License only
  SME Plus:         License + 1-2 add-ons
  Enterprise:       License + add-ons + training
  Government:       Full scope + support + documentation
```

### Maintenance Calculation

```
Year 1:     Included in license
Year 2+:    license_price × maintenance_rate (typically 20%)

Maintenance includes:
  - Software updates
  - Security patches
  - Compatibility updates
  - Email support
```

## Response Patterns

### Pricing Response Structure

1. **Header** - What's being quoted
2. **Price Box** - Clear price display
3. **Includes** - What's covered
4. **Add-ons** - Optional extras
5. **Terms** - Payment, validity
6. **Notes** - Important caveats

### Partner Response Structure

1. **Channel Info** - Type, margin, role
2. **Split Calculation** - Who gets what
3. **Responsibilities** - Partner vs you
4. **MAP Warning** - Minimum price if applicable

### Quotation Response Structure

1. **Header** - Customer, date, validity
2. **Line Items** - Numbered, with amounts
3. **Total** - Clear sum
4. **Optional Add-ons** - Upsell opportunities
5. **Terms** - Payment terms
6. **Notes** - Conditions

## Output Directory Convention

All sales commands write their output to `docs/sales-kit/` in the project directory:

```
docs/sales-kit/
├── README.md         ← Index (generated by /sales)
├── pricing.md        ← /sales-get-pricing output
├── marketing.md      ← /sales-get-marketing output
└── quotation.md      ← /sales-get-quotation output
```

- Create the directory if it doesn't exist.
- Each file is a proper Markdown document with a title header, generation date, and product name.
- Terminal output should be minimal — just a confirmation message with the file path.

## Formatting Standards

### Currency Display

```
MYR 25,000      # With currency prefix
RM 25,000       # Malaysian shorthand
USD 5,000       # US dollars
$5,000          # Dollar shorthand

Ranges:
MYR 10,000 - 25,000
```

### Tables

Use box drawing for clarity:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header                                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Content                              Amount     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TOTAL                                XX,XXX     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Emphasis

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════  (major sections)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────  (sub-sections)
```

## FAQ Response Patterns

Group FAQs by category:

1. **Deployment** - How to install, requirements
2. **Pricing** - Costs, payment terms
3. **Features** - What's included, limitations
4. **Support** - What's covered, response times
5. **Partners** - Channel options, margins

## Marketing Response Patterns

### Taglines

- Keep under 10 words
- Focus on benefit or transformation
- Avoid jargon

### Elevator Pitch

- 50-75 words
- Structure: Problem → Solution → Differentiator → CTA
- End with price or action

### Social Media

- Match platform tone
- Include emojis sparingly for casual
- Always end with CTA/link
- Suggest hashtags

### ROI Calculation

- Use concrete numbers
- Show monthly AND annual impact
- Include "soft" benefits too

## Reading Product Config

Look for `product-config.md` in:

1. Current directory
2. Project root
3. Parent directories

If not found, prompt user to create one using template.

## Error Handling

### Missing Config

```
⚠️  No product-config.md found

To use pricing commands, create a product config:
  cp ~/.claude/product-config-template.md ./product-config.md

Then edit with your product details.
```

### Missing Required Fields

```
⚠️  Missing required field: base_price

Please add to your product-config.md:
  base_price: 25000
```

### Invalid Scenario

```
❓ I didn't understand that pricing scenario.

Try:
  /sales-get-pricing license
  /sales-get-pricing via reseller
  /sales-get-pricing government full

Or describe what you need:
  /sales-get-pricing for 5 users with monitoring and training
```
